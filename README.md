# DigitalOcean
Repository for DigitalOcean CloudTitans Hackathon participants

# Important Note to all innovators: GitHub account is mandatory to submit your soultion.


# Steps
1. Create your own folder inside repository and create README.md file with your team details. One folder per team.
2. Read and try to understand the problem definition, prepare your own solution(max. two pages) and upload it on your folder on this repository.
3. Download the dataset from https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19/download. Download metadata.csv file. This file consists of abstract of research papers.
4. Apply text processing and Natural language processing techniques to generate the summary. You can generate summary from a single paper, multiple papers and group them.
5. Extract keywords and identify the relationship between keywords and show the relationship with the help of visualization.
6. Go through the URL: https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19 . This will help you to understand the context. I am expecting a simple solution. Not as complicated as given in the above URL.
7. Try to develop a Question Answer system based on the dataset. Please note I am NOT expecting chat-bot.
8. Some examples of visualization can be found here. Innovators are free to come up with their own visualization.

NOTE: Although I prefer Python or Julia personally but not mandatory. You are free to use your choice of programming language and associated libraries as long as it is supported and deployed on DigitalOcean platform. You are free to add your innovation to the solution and it is better to have edge over others. When you are developing a solution have a mindset of developing it like a product complete in all sense and professional look and feel. Upload code and screenshot in your respective folders.

If you have questions please write in comments.
